Using a scripted-field (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/scripted-fields.html) to map http status codes to status code text.
This is usually done via the Kibana-Web-Interface and then automatically applied by kibana at search time.

Scripted-Fields are passed to a Elasticsearch query (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-fields.html#script-fields).
This PoC shows how scripted-fields are applied. In Kibana they can be created in 'Stack Management > Index Patterns > Select Index Pattern > Scripted Fields'.

Scripted fields are limited in their usage in further search by the same request, but can be used in visualizations in Kibana
